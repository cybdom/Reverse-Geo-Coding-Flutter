A bare bones reverse geocoding app in flutter that allows the user to know his current address as well as any address on the map.
Features: 

    1. Ask user location permission
    
    2. Get current user location.
    
    3. Show current user location on the map.
    
    4. Tap to add a marker to the map.
    
    5. Get full address of a marker.

    <img src="screenshot_1.png" height="480px">
    <img src="screenshot_2.png" height="480px">
